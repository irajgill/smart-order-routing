Smart Order Router
A comprehensive smart order routing system for decentralized exchange aggregation on the Hyperliquid ecosystem. This project automatically finds the best trading prices across multiple DEXs, optimizes for price execution, minimizes gas costs, and provides seamless user experience.

🚀 Features
Core Functionality
Multi-Pool Route Splitting: Split large trades across up to 7 different liquidity pools simultaneously

Cross-Protocol Integration: Support for HyperSwap V2/V3, KittenSwap (Stable/V3/Volatile), and Laminar V3

Gas-Aware Optimization: Real-time gas cost calculations with USD cost display

Dynamic Slippage Management: Automatic slippage adjustment based on trade size and market conditions

Oracle Integration: Time-weighted average price (TWAP) feeds with fallback mechanisms

Advanced Features
Intelligent Route Discovery: Pathfinding algorithms that explore liquidity across multiple venues

Price Impact Minimization: Optimal trade distribution to reduce market impact

Real-time Route Computation: Low latency route calculation with caching

Cross-Layer Support: Optimized for Layer 2 specific gas mechanics

Emergency Controls: Pause mechanisms and comprehensive security measures

Performance Targets
✅ Handle trades up to $100M+ with minimal price impact

✅ Achieve 15%+ price improvements on trades

✅ Reduce gas costs by 20-45% compared to direct routing

✅ Support $1B+ monthly trade volumes

✅ Maintain 99.9% uptime for routing services
